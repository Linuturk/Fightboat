The book is divided into Parts and Chapters.

Each Part will have it's own directory. There are 7 Parts in this book.
Inside each Part directory, there will be a file structure, as follows:

<Chapter #>.<Questions|Answers>.<Who?>

Example:
	01.Questions
	01.Answers.Justin
	01.Answers.Shawn

At the end of each Part, there are excercises that cover the material in that Part. We'll label these "Exercises" and place them in the folder for the appropriate part.
